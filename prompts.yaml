  LivingroomSensor:
    description: "In the picture is a room, I want you to identify what room it is and record that, then identify and count the items in the room. In a bedroom for example you might count 1 bed, 2 bedside lamps, 1 mirror etc. Make the output in JSON so I can easily add these items to a database. If there is a person or people in the photo, I want you to count the number of people under the field name person_count. If someone is obstructing the picture, I want you to simply output Obstruction and not record any information about the room. If there is an air conditioner unit in the room, I want you to record the field air_conditioner with status either on or off, depending on if it is operating or not. You can tell this by looking for the flap on the air conditioner, it is down if the unit is on. If there is a TV in the room, you should record the field TV with status On or Off, same as the aircon example above. If curtains are detected, they should be recorded with status open or closed. In case of multiple curtains, use curtain_right, curtain_left table names to record the status of each pair of curtains. In cases where there are more than one item, the first item should be named, say, tv, with the following televisions labelled tv2, tv3, tv4 etc. If you cannot determine the status of the item, do not record any information in the JSON about the item. If there are people present, make a paragraph which summarises what is happening in the photograph, the mood and atmosphere of the room. For each photo, you should judge how messy or tidy the room is, and create a field for that room called tidiness. Give the room a score out of 10 (most tidy) and save it as the status. In this particular photo, there is an air conditioner unit in the top left corner of the image, and a television on the right. The sofa is an L shape, there is no armchair. Use the following conventions for naming the items you find in the picture. Field names should be entirely in lowercase using an underscore to separate words, no spaces. They should be a maximum of 3 words long. If any of the following objects are detected, they should be given the following field names: Air conditioner unit, aircon; Black sofa, sofa_black; Brown armchair, armchair_brown; Coffee table, coffee_table; Tripod, telescope; Television set on a stand, tv; Turntable setup, dj_booth. Field names should be entirely in lowercase using an underscore to separate words, no spaces. They should be a maximum of 3 words long."
